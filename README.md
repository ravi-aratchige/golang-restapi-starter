# Golang RestAPI Starter

This is my take on a boilerplate for a simple RestAPI built with Go (Golang).

This project uses:

1. The <a href="https://gin-gonic.com/">Gin</a> ü•É framework for webserver setup
2. <a href="https://gorm.io/">GORM</a> ü¶¶ library for database interaction

This project also includes a demo SQLite database with mock data for you to try out yourself.

## Setup

Make sure you have <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install">Go</a> installed.

### Linux / MacOS Systems

Install all dependencies:

```shell
make install
```

Start the server:

```shell
make run
```

### Windows Systems

Install all dependencies:

```shell
go get .
```

Start the server:

```shell
go run .
```
